# SeHAS Workshop Page: International Workshop on Secure Hardware, Architectures, and Software

In today's digital landscape, the security and resilience of hardware and software systems have become paramount concerns. To combat the evolving threat landscape and the potential consequences of cyberattacks, security research plays a vital role in identifying vulnerabilities and developing robust defenses. Whether focusing on hardware or software, dedicated research is a stepping stone for safeguarding our digital ecosystem.
In the International Workshop on Secure Hardware, Architectures, and Software, we invite leading researchers in the field to delve into the latest security threats, solutions, and emerging technologies. This workshop aims to provide an international forum for researchers, practitioners, and administrators from security and related disciplines to exchange perspectives, share lessons learned, and gain new insights into securing hardware, architectures, and software. Join us as we collectively explore and contribute to the advancement of secure technologies.
